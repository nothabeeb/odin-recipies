    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Budin is a dish that originated in Spain and is similar to a bread pudding. It typically consists of slices of
        bread soaked in milk, eggs, sugar, and cinnamon, and is often flavored with vanilla or lemon zest. The mixture
        is then baked until it forms a custard-like texture. Budin can be served warm or cold, and is often garnished
        with fruit, whipped cream, or caramel sauce. It is a popular dessert in many Spanish-speaking countries and is
        often made with regional variations, such as adding chocolate or rum to the mixture.
